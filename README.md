### Pairwise testing
- using pairwise testing, helped me to reduce the number of test cases without sacrificing coverage of the program's functionality. It is in this case, I have covered 160 variants in 21 use cases by using pairwise testing.

### Decision table testing
- in this table, I used two variants: in the first variant, I detailed all possible interactions between conditions and actions, while in the second variant, everything relied solely on the condition of having sufficient funds in the PayPal account. If these funds are insufficient, then the payment will not go through in any case, even if the PayPal account is Valid. Therefore, I decided to streamline this table in the second variant and left only those columns where the condition "sufficient funds in the PayPal account" is marked as "yes."
